## **Movie Recommendation System**

---


1. **Project Overview**

   
This project is a Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies based on their genres, 
popularity, and descriptions. The dataset used includes movies with details such as title, 
genre, original language, overview, popularity, and release date. 
The recommendation model works by analyzing movie similarities using content-based 
filtering, where movies with similar genres, descriptions, or popularity scores are 
recommended to users 

Example Entries from the Dataset: 
• The Shawshank Redemption – A drama/crime movie about a man framed for murder in the 
1940s. 
• Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge – A Hindi-language romantic drama. 
• The Godfather – A classic mafia crime drama.
